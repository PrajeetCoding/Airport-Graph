# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
We will meet sometime between 4-7 on Thursday depending on our schedules and we will add more meetings depending the tasks to be accomplished. Our meetings will last at least an hour and will go on longer depending on what needs to be finished. We will meet through discord. We will collectively take meeting notes and document what we've accomplished at the end of each meeting. 
2. **Assistance** 
We will communicate with each other through discord. We will be expected to respond within a day to any personal messages.

3. **Respect** 
We will always take the opinions of all the team members before deciding on how to proceed therefore ensuring that every team member has a voice. If any team member is allowing others to express their opinions we will talk to that person and ensure that they act in a more considerate manner. 
## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
We will first discuss the strengths and weaknesses of everyone on the team and ensure that they are being assigned based on their strengths. Then, we will ensure that workload is split an equal manner such that the tasks across team members take roughly the same time. 

5. **Time Commitment**
We can expect at least three hours of work for each team member. We will try to be ahead of schedule as much as possible to ensure that if any time conflicts or inter-personal conflicts happen, we have time to resolve them and ensure that we stay on track.

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
We will take the majority opinion when a disagreement occurs and also carefully weigh both sides to make sure we are making the best decision for the team. When team members are not accomplishing tasks or showing up to meetings, we will have open communication on the issue and try to figure out what is prompting it so we can resolve the matter.
