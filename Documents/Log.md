# Development Log 

## Date: 10/31/22 -- 11/04/22
## Weekly Goals
We had the goal of completing the team contract and all preliminary work necessary too begin coding.  As we have created the github and detailed our plans for the project, this has been accomplished.

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
Kevin created the github repository, and we all contributed to writing out the contract and the project proposal.

## Problems Encountered 
We did not encounter any problems.

## Plans for next week
We plan to complete the csv parser by the end of next week and hopefully begin work on implementing the graph class.

## Optional: Questions for mentor
Do we need to add the mentor to the github repository?

## Date: 11/07/22 -- 11/11/22

## Weekly Goals

This week, our main goals were to:
- Complete the CSV parsing functions
- Test the CSV parsing functions and debug them
- Rewrite/resubmit the project proposal

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)

Aakarsh - Attempted to implement test cases locally to account for varied cases within the spectrum of the csv parser, yet to push these changes

Kevin Liu - Implemented the CSV parser, reorganized the Github Repository, and implemented the CMake files to allow for everyone to compile their code.

Prajeet - Implemented test cases for the CSV parsing functions. Fixed a bug where the csv parser added quotations around the names of the airports.

## Problems Encountered 

- No problems encountered this week.

## Plans for next week

- We plan on implementing and testing the Graph class (**not including Djikstra's Algorithm, BFS, and Betweenness Centrality**) and hopefully finish it by the end of next week.

## Optional: Questions for mentor

- N / A

## Date: 11/14/22 -- 11/18/22 

## Weekly Goals

- Debug issues with handling "null" values in the CSVParser
- Implement the Graph class

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
- Kevin: Implemented the Graph class
- Prajeet: Fixed some bug where the CSVParser had issues handling "\N" character. Implemented the distance calculation function to use for weights.  Started work on bfs and traversals class.
- Aakarsh:  Started work on traversals class.

## Problems Encountered

- Ran into some unknown bug with the csv parser, currently trying to figure out what is going on with it


## Plans for next week
- Finish Djikstra's and BFS search bare minimum
- Write test cases for everything to make sure all parts up to Djikstra's and BFS work

## Optional: Questions for mentor

- N / A

## Date: 11/19/22 -- 12/2/22

## Weekly Goals

- Finish implementing Djikstra's algorithm and BFS
- Begin adding test cases for Djikstra's and BFS and Graph class
- Start implementing Betweenness centrality

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)

- Kevin: implemented BFS and Djikstra's algorithm and printPath function
- Prajeet: fixed a bug with Djikstra's algorithm, added test cases for Graph class
- Aakarsh: assisted in development with traversals class

## Problems Encountered

- N/A

## Plans for next week

We plan on finishing the project next week, thus we will:
- Finish Betweeness centrality
- Add extensive testing (adding more test cases) for all parts of the project
- Implement CMD line arguments

## Optional: Questions for mentor

- N / A
